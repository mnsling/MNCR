This is a fully responsive ecommerce website featuring a BTS popup: monochrome theme. The website includes:

- **Home Page**: The main landing page showcasing the BTS popup.
- **Events Page**: Updates and information about upcoming events.
- **Shop Page**: A section where BTS merchandise is available for purchase.
- **Memory Cloud**: A section where you can send messages to BTS [not working tho ^.^].

Built using ReactJS, this project focuses on frontend development to showcase my design skills. There is no backend implementation, highlighting my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
